# Style Transfer
*by Aryan Mann and Stefan Ilic*

Any visit to an art museum leaves the observer with a sense of the style of each individual work. This project aims to create a process by which the style of one painting is transferred to another algorithmically. The result is a beautiful fusion between the content and style between two art pieces.
